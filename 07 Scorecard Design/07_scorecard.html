	<h1> Scorecard </h1>
	<div class="description"><p><a href="#functional_requirements">Functional requirements</a> and <a href="#qualtiy_attributes">quality attributes</a>, with weights, that the user will use to score alternative solutions. This is input to the Concept Selection step (next).

	<p>Our team debated between a physical game and a computer game. We decided to pursue the physical game route because it would be more engaging for the players to play the game with their friends in person than playing online alone. Furthermore, the computer software game would be much more timely to build and prototype, which delays our go to market plans. 
<br><br>
When designing our physical game, we came up with a list of functional requirements and quality attributes that we wanted our game to fulfill. Primarily, we wanted our game to focus on delivering our mission, so the higher weighted attributes both are relevant to option seeking and decision making. Other game elements, such as rules and feedback, are necessary but not as important to the mission so they are given lower weights. Below are the two scorecard designs:
